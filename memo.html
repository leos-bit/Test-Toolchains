      <h3>Target Employer and Key Skills</h3>
      <p>
        I am targeting roles in semiconductor manufacturing & design, robotics startups, and physical AI teams.
        These employers value systems thinking, reliable deployment, and evidence of end-to-end ownership. The
        portfolio foregrounds mechatronics integration, data-driven diagnostics, embedded controls, and applied ML.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h3>Content Choices</h3>
      <p>
        I selected four projects/experiences that demonstrate technical depth and social value: semiconductor tool
        modernization (improving uptime and yield), a solar-powered robot (energy-aware autonomy), an AI game agent
        (learning under uncertainty), and connected mobility systems. Each entry follows an IMRD/IDEC structure and
        explicitly names my contributions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h3>Audience Alignment</h3>
      <p>
        For employers focused on reliability and throughput, I emphasize measurable outcomes (uptime, downtime,
        stability). For robotics and physical AI teams, I highlight kinematic design, controls, and learning systems.
        The layout makes skills quickly scannable through project headings, metrics, and tags.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h3>Design Rationale</h3>
      <p>
        The design prioritizes clarity and fast navigation. A clean minimal layout, high-contrast typography, and
        generous whitespace improve readability. Cards separate projects to reduce cognitive load. Consistent
        navigation eliminates broken paths, while the resume and memo are placed in dedicated pages for quick access.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h3>Future Enhancements</h3>
      <p>
        I plan to add demo videos of the terrain walker and tooling dashboards, and include a short project summary
        video for rapid review.
